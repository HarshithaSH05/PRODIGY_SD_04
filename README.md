## Sudoku Solver

This project is a Sudoku Solver built using Python that solves a 9×9 Sudoku puzzle automatically using the Backtracking Algorithm.

The program allows users to:

Enter their own Sudoku puzzle

Load example puzzles

View the unsolved puzzle first

See the solved puzzle step-by-step in the console

This project demonstrates problem-solving skills, recursion, and algorithm implementation in Python.

## Features

- Solve any valid 9×9 Sudoku puzzle
- Load example Sudoku puzzles
- Shows unsolved puzzle first
- Displays solved puzzle clearly
- Fast solving using Backtracking
- Simple console interface

## Technologies Used

Python 3

Backtracking Algorithm

Recursion

## How to Run

Step 1 — Install Python

Step 2 - Open terminal in project folder and run: python sudoku.py

## How It Works

The Sudoku puzzle is solved using the Backtracking Algorithm:

Find an empty cell (represented by 0)

Try numbers from 1 to 9

Check if the number is valid

Continue recursively

Backtrack if needed

Display solved Sudoku

## Example Puzzle

Example unsolved Sudoku:
```
0 0 0 2 6 0 7 0 1
6 8 0 0 7 0 0 9 0
1 9 0 0 0 4 5 0 0
8 2 0 1 0 0 0 4 0
0 0 4 6 0 2 9 0 0
